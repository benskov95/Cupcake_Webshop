/**
 * The PresentationLayer package most importantly

 * Command class. Every other class works in tandem
 * with Command, which in turn works with the
 * FrontController.
 *
 * All classes in this package have to do with
 * functions and actions related to our jsp
 * pages. Without them, the individual jsp
 * pages don't do anything.
